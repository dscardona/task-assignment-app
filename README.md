This is my first attempt at designing and implementing the back end of a web based application that interacts with a database.

As indicated by its name, the task-assignment app allows users to match a number of participants to a set of tasks. Before the actual assigning takes place, the user must add participants and tasks to the corresponding tables. Once this is done, the app will randomly generate the assignments. All the tasks will be matched with a participant. Participant may be assigned to more than one task if the number of tasks exceeds the number of participants. If the number of participants is greater than the number of tasks, some participants will be spared from participating.

This app at its most basic state can be used for general task assignment of any kind, i.e. professional/domestic settings, etc. My hope is to keep upgrading it as I become a more proficient web developer.
